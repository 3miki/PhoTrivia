The AI photo quiz game is a fun and interactive app that combines conversational AI and vision capabilities. Players can upload their photos, and the app generates quiz questions and answers based on the images. 

Perfect for events like Christmas parties or gatherings, this app creates a unique opportunity for friends and family to share their favorite photos and stories from the year while enjoying an engaging AI-hosted quiz game.

With conversational AI integration, the game becomes even more immersive, as an AI host guides players through questions, interacts dynamically with participants, and reveals answers in a lively, conversational manner.
